#### ‚ö† Notes:
- Currently, the app can **NOT** modify playlists that are in the watch already (as the playlist files need to be inside the cache folder), make sure to keep and backup all playlist files that are inside the cache folder.

- Tested on Debian 12 (KDE), contribute to confirm working status on other systems.

#### ‚úàÔ∏é Installation:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- `pip install pymtp-gf-0.1.1.tar.gz`
